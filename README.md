# Hello 👋 My name is Nathan Lindblade

## About Me🤖

I am a Junior at Florida State University pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I love coding and I am eager to enter the world of Software. Currently, I am looking for an internship for the spring/summer 2024. All of my code has been done independently, so I would love to start collaborating with other people on different projects.
